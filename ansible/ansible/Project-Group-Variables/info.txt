Group variables in Ansible allow you to define variables that are shared among multiple hosts within a specific group. This can be useful for setting common configurations, defining constants, or specifying group-specific details. Group variables are typically stored in a file named group_vars/group_name.yml, where group_name is the name of the group for which you want to define variables.
